        <strong>Profession:</strong> Technical Recruiter with Google, a long-standing Fortune 500 company that is looking to hire full-time
        college grads or individuals who have completed a bootcamp with applicable experience.  They are the Number One
        site that is used daily to conduct research.  The average age for daily users are 13-50 and is an excellent choice for High School and College students.

        <strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Bill is a very ornery individual who typically doesn't spend more than 2 minutes on anyone's resume.  He is a big believer in zip recruiter along with finding talent through social media websites, i.e. LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.
        <br>
        <strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Bill needs to hire a Junior Software Developer is proficient in HTML5, CSS3,
        JavaScript, BootStrap, Angular, Visual Studio and WebStorm.  The individual needs to be a team player, one who works
        well autonomous and within a team environment.  The individual also needs to have a high level of maturity due to the
        remote work environment.  Bill is having a hard time selecting the right person for the job who meets the criteria listed.  His supervisor gave
        him a deadline of three weeks to find a new hire.
        <br>
        <strong>Goals:</strong> Bill's primary concern is choosing the right candidate.  Is he able to choose the right candidate
        with his 2-minute resume review timeframe? If he does will the candidate have the minimum qualifications to conduct the job properly.
        <br>
    <strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, will he be able to find the right qualities needed to hire.
