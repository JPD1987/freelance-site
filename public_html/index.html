                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                        <p class="ABME">I am Full Stack Web Developer and entrepreneur.  Over the last decade I have served
                            in numerous Communication, Computer Networking and Software Development roles within the military and civilian sector.
                            My Communication career began in the military when I served as the Senior Communication's Sergeant for my Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA)
                            in the Continental United States and countries abroad.  After 11 years of service, I retired from active service in 2016 receiving an honorable discharge;
                            I moved to the civilian sector and started working for Level 3 communications which was then bought out by Centurylink in 2018. My roles in the company
                            were Field Technician and One Call Specialist 3.  After 3 years of working in the telecommunications industry I decided to leave and focus on my real estate
                            portfolio full time.  In 2021, I decided I wanted to take up a new career path and become a full-time software developer.
                            Software Development has always been an interest of mine; I took the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp through
                            CNM Ingenuity graduating in December 2021.

                <h3 class="FSD">FULL STACK DEVELOPER</h3>
                    <p class="FSE">Full stack is most commonly used when referring to web developers. A full stack web developer works with both the front and back end of a website or application.
                    They are proficient in both front-end and back-end languages and frameworks, as well as server, network, and hosting environments.
                    Full-stack developers need to be proficient in languages used for front-end development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third-party libraries and extensions for Web development
                    such as JQuery, SASS, and REACT. Mastery of these front-end programming languages will need to be combined with knowledge of UI design as well as customer experience design for creating
                    optimal front-facing websites and applications.
                    Full-stack developers also need to know how to code in back-end languages like JAVA, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, and C in order to ensure their
                    front-end websites and applications are able to integrate with back-end business applications and infrastructure. Knowledge of databases and languages to interact with databases
                    like MySQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server is also essential.
                    The term full stack web developer has generated some controversy, as some believe “full stack” is the very definition of a software developer. They say calling someone a “full stack” developer
                    is equivalent to calling a doctor a “full medical” doctor.</p>

                <h3 class="FRE">FULLY RESPONSIVE</h3>
                    <p class="FRDE">With the relentless rise in mobile phone and tablet use, a modern website needs to adapt to a near-infinite number of screen types.
                    A fully responsive website will rescale itself to preserve the user experience and look and feel across all devices — with no
                    irritating zooming, scrolling or resizing. These days web users crave consistency and an elegant User Experience (UX), and they’ll eject
                    if your site isn’t fully responsive. In responsive website development, code detects and responds to all types of devices — a speciality of
                    our UX and Web Design department. However, for a fully optimised website, you also need a front end developer to straddle the worlds of design
                    and technology, to determine the look and feel of the site through cascading style sheets (CSS), developed through HTML, JavaScript and other languages.</p>

                    <h3 class="WD">WEB DESIGN</h3>
                    <p class="WD-WORD">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers
                        to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design
                        used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for
                        mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
                        A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website.
                        A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.
                        Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that
                        might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the
                        trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.
                        Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and
                        adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout
                        sizes that match common screen sizes. If they are responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skill-set, they will
                        enjoy having the advantage of full control of the finished product.</p>
